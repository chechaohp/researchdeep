\item \subquestionpoints{2}  One issue with the weighted importance sampling estimator is that it can be biased in many finite sample situations. In finite samples, we replace the expected value with a sum over the seen values in our observational dataset. Please show that the weighted importance sampling estimator is biased in these situations.

Hint: Consider the case where there is only a single data element in your observational dataset.
